Boss Development Map This repository contains an AI-assisted project of a map in development, open for collaboration. The main goal is to catalog the existing bosses at the moment. Once all bosses are marked on the map, we will expand to include dungeons, items, and other elements.

Nothing is defined in terms of final libraries and languages. The code still needs a lot of work to make it lighter and easier to use. For now, the goal is to develop everything in HTML, JavaScript, and SQL to create a place for documentation of the base elements used. Here are some ideas for the expected format for the elements to be documented: { "category_id": x, "title": "x", "description": "x", "latitude": "x", "longitude": "x", "wiki id": "x" } not yet implemented Let's work together to create a valuable resource for the gaming community!
